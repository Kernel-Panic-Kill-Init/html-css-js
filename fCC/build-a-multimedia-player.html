<p><strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong>
<br><br>
I know this pretty rave girl, always think about her
And when she says "Hi" to me, butterflies go right through me
And when I see her dancing, wanna take a chance and
Get in a little closer, and maybe get to know her
I know this pretty rave girl, always think about her
And when she says "Hi" to me, butterflies go right through me
And when I see her dancing, wanna take a chance and
Get in a little closer
<br><br>
<strong>[Chorus]</strong>
<br><br>
I-I-I-I know this pretty rave girl, always think about her
And when she says "Hi" to me, butterflies go right through me
And when I see her dancing, wanna take a chance and
Get in a little closer, and maybe get to know her
I know this pretty rave girl, always think about her
And when she says "Hi" to me, butterflies go right through me
And when I see her dancing, wanna take a chance and
Get in a little closer, and maybe get to know her

<strong>[Bridge]</strong>
  <br><br>
I-I-I-I-I-I wanna find a girl like you
'Cause you're the girl for me, it's true
When I dream, I dream of you
And everything that we could do
You're on my mind all day and night
My feelings grow stronger with time
Now my heart beats just for you
I only hope you feel it too
